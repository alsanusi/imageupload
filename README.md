Basic Upload Image and Image File Size Reducer in Express.js

## Guides
For the very first time, you need to run this command:
```
npm install
```

Since this web app contain sql db, you need to **export the sql file to your local machine**.

In order to run the web app, you need to install **nodemon**, by run this command:
```
npm install nodemon
```

After installing nodemon, you can start the web app, with this command:
```
nodemon app.js
```
